## A brief description:

- This project is a player selection app featuring a responsive Navbar displaying the userâ€™s coin balance, a Banner for adding coins, and a Main Section to toggle between available and selected players. Player details load from JSON and are shown in a card layout with a "Choose Player" button, allowing users to select players based on coin availability.

# Technologies used:
- React: For building the user interface and managing component-based structure.
- React-Toastify: For enhanced user notifications instead of standard alerts.
- JSON: For storing and managing player data.
- CSS / Tailwind CSS: For styling the components to match the Figma design and ensure responsiveness.
- JavaScript: For implementing logic such as coin balance updates, player selection, and validation.
- Vite: For faster project setup and development environment.

# 3 key features of your project:
- Dynamic Player Selection with Coin Management: Users can select players based on their coin balance, which they can increase via the Banner. Validation ensures players can't exceed the maximum selection or choose the same player twice.

- Toggling View for Available and Selected Players: A toggle feature in the Main Section allows users to switch between viewing available players and their selected players, providing a smooth selection experience.

- Interactive Notifications with React-Toastify: All alerts are replaced by React-Toastify notifications, enhancing user feedback and ensuring a polished interaction flow.
