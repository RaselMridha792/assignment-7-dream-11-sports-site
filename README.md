## A brief description:

- This project is a player selection app featuring a responsive Navbar displaying the user’s coin balance, a Banner for adding coins, and a Main Section to toggle between available and selected players. Player details load from JSON and are shown in a card layout with a "Choose Player" button, allowing users to select players based on coin availability.

Selected players display with details and a "Remove" button, with notifications managed through React-Toastify. Additional features include a newsletter, footer, and validations limiting selection to six players. The app’s title is customized, avoiding default names like "Vite-React."
